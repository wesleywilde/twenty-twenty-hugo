Hello and welcome to my autistic life! This is a personal blog that I wanted to start to help inform others about the autistic experience as well as to give others going through similar experiences hope and knowing that they too aren't alone. I'm not sure where this will go but I hope it touches at least another person and they are grateful for this resource.
